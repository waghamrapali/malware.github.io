A new piece of mobile malware has been discovered in Google Play masquerading as multiple apps: an alarm clock app, a QR scanner app, a compass app, a photo editor app, an Internet speed test app, and a file explorer app. 
According to Google Play data, all were last updated between October and November 2017.  
These dates are likely when they were added to Google Play, based on their low version numbers (e.g. 1.0, 1.0.1).
