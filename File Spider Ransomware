The File Spider Ransomware is an encryption ransomware Trojan that is being distributed on the Dark Web.
The File Spider Ransomware uses a combination of the AES and RSA encryptions to make victims' files unusable. The purpose of these attacks is to take the victim's files hostage and then demand payment from the computer user in exchange for the decryption key. The File Spider Ransomware will target the user-generated files while avoiding the Windows system files. The File Spider Ransomware encrypts an extraordinarily large number of file types compared to most encryption ransomware Trojans. While most of these threats will encrypt several dozen types of files, the File Spider Ransomware will encrypt more than one thousand file types in its attacks. 
The File Spider Ransomware is designed to attack computer users in south-eastern Europe.
